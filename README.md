Funciones y utilidades para la gestión de datasets

-----

It is a Python package that provides features and utilities for dataset management. This package has been developed as part of the subject Mathematical and Statistical Software of the EHU/UPV master KISA.

Functionalities

The main features implemented in this package are:

- **Discretionance**: Discretion algorithms for a single attribute and for a complete dataset, using the same frequency and equal width method.
- **Métrics**: Calculation of metrics such as variance and AUC (for continuous variables) and entropy (for discrete variables).
- **Normalization and standardization**: Functions to normalize and standardize variables, both individually and for the complete dataset.
- **Vorberate rush**: Obtaining a new dataset where all variables meet certain requirements defined by the implemented metrics.
- **Correlation**: Calculation of correlation (or mutual information for categorical variables) by peers between the variables of a dataset.
- **Visualization**: Plots to represent AUC and correlation/net of information matrices.


Requirements
